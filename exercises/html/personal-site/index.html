        <p>Hi everyone,</p>
        <p>
            Two months ago, I never thought that I can build a website by my own codes, and you know what, here is my first website. So welcome to my personal website !</p>
        <p>
            Today we see an ever increasingly demand of software anywhere. Everybody wants a piece of software in their works. Bosses require a dashboard that can animate latest data and report of everything with a click. Employees ask for tools to automate their daily complex and boring tasks. So do I, in my work, I need more and more new tools to deal with my business. Then I decided to start learning to code. Not sure how far I can go with this new game, but a good news is that I am now excited playing with HTML, CSS, NodeJS in my <a class="hover-red" href="https://comit.org/"><strong>ComIT</strong></a> class.
        </p>

            Starting to build a software project with your own idea is a good way to stay focus on learning programming language and it is very stressfull though, as you probably get stuck in almost every line of codes. But you will see, soon as you resolve it you feel so great. So if you can keep up with it for long then you can finish the project; and congratulation you will be a coder sooner or later !
        </p>

            Cheers
